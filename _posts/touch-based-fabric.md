## Customer Challenges:

1. To Improve the Product quality along with reducing Manpower and boosting up the production line.

## Solutions:

- A textile industry where we installed 10 nos. FIDL systems in Weaving & Folding department, running 24Ã—7 non-stop without any issue since November 2017.

- Production & operator working efficiency is almost increased up to 30-40%. Supervisor & Manager gets live MIS reports for every data logger on single click from Central-Server

- Supervisor & Manager gets live MIS reports for every data logger on single click from Central-Server Report Utility.

- Also, we installed & integrate packaging barcode sticker generation system for FG-fabric roll packaging with fabric inspection data loggers. At the time of packaging, user needs to only scan inspection sticker which automatically generates packaging sticker.

- This add-on boosted up the overall working process and reduced the manual data entry process.

- The Fabric Inspection Data Logger (FIDL) is an integrated and customized data logger for textile industries.

- It logs data for fabric inspection and generate MIS in required & proper format.
