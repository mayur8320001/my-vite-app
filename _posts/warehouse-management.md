## Customer Challenges:

1. To manage the dispatch process of a warehouse

## Solutions:

- WDMS ensures valid carton/bales to be load & dispatch against DO/SO generated from SAP irrespective of number of dispatch & loading points.
- Hand Held Terminal (HHT) device software allows having user friendly UI and only unique and valid carton/bales to be load into truck.
- WDMS desktop system provides you single dashboard on which the overall process will become easy, fast, efficient irrespective of user’s or operator’s knowledge.

- SAP generates Z-pick list, system loads picklist into HHT, user scans cartons/bales, system unloads data from HHT and generate DO for only valid and scanned cartons/bales and generate csv file for SAP import.

- This ensures proper invoicing of valid dispatched material will be done by SAP users.

- Major advantage is no manual entries to do in the overall system and if there is no manual entry then no chances of having errors in loading cartons/bales into truck.
