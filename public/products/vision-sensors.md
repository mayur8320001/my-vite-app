Industrial vision sensors bridge the gap between standard photoelectric sensors and costly machine vision systems with a more powerful and flexible solution. They have been set up for easy installation and operation without programming language. Vision sensors are significantly more efficient and flexible than light barriers, for example, and they are distinctly simpler in design due to the configuration for one special field of application, and thus less expensive than conventional industrial vision systems.

Vision sensors use images captured by a camera to determine presence, orientation, and accuracy of parts. These sensors differ from image inspection “systems” in that the camera, light, and controller are contained in a single unit, which makes the unit’s construction and operation simple. There are differences between these sensors and other general-purpose sensors. For example, multi-point inspections can be done with a single sensor. In addition, thanks to the wide field of view, detection is possible even when the target position is not consistent.

Key Features

- Customized to meet the needs of various Applications, Vision sensors deliver a powerful and flexible Solution.

- They are designed for simple installations and operations without the need for programming knowledge.

- Vision sensors are much more efficient and flexible than Photoelectric sensors, but their design is simpler, and therefore more cot effective than traditional Imaging Systems.

- Vision sensors are particularly suited for sorting, checking, and evaluation. They are used, for example for rack fine positioning systems in high rack storage areas or to detect Incorrect Sheets in print post-processing.
