The complex distribution networks of supply chain and logistics are prone to product counterfeiting. With the use of Tracking and Tracing Solutions, which applies a unique RFID or serialized barcode identifier on items, packages, cases or pallets, the industry-wide concerns can be effectively resolved by providing a reliable product pedigree as it contains the traceable history of each ownership change along the supply chain.

Furthermore, it gives total transparency via a real-time centralized platform for information sharing to all related stakeholders across the entire supply chain, from sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, to wholesaling, and to Point-of-Sales (POS).

Compliant with industry best practices, our turnkey solutions meet the mandate of global standard and interoperate with various legacy systems. With the provision of real-time information, a reliable product authenticity can be ensured with accurate and better control of inventory.

##### Barcode based material tracking system or WIP (Work In Process)

The success of many businesses comes down to accountability and efficiency. Every manufacturing or maintenance and repair organization (MRO) is faced with similar challenges to job and work order status tracking – lost orders, incorrect builds and delays are all typical results of an inferior tracking system. Having a robust Work in Process (WIP) system in place will help you meet compliance mandates, be prepared for any potential recalls or issues and increase efficiency to provide better customer service.

With the right WIP software and scanning hardware you can provide your business with the means to track vital manufacturing data in real-time. Improve build accuracy and reduce labor costs by providing your employees with all the information they need with no paperwork and less procedural steps. Start making more strategic decisions based on the status of every phase of your production process.

##### Key Benefits of a Work In Process System

- Efficiency – Automate aspects of your process while eliminating paperwork.

- Accuracy – Reduce errors from manual or missed input data.

- Traceability – Know what stage every item is at in your facility with real-time information.

- Productivity – Accomplish more throughout the day with a streamlined and automated process.

##### What is Work In Process?

Work in process (WIP) is a common tracking function found at any manufacturing facility as well as repair centers to manage items as they move throughout a facility. The core concern behind a WIP system is making sure you have the ability to collect and track specific details of each stage in your production process. With the use of barcodes and scanning technology, a system will reduce unnecessary steps while providing an accurate view of the state of everything in your facility.

In a WIP system, each item is tracked uniquely as it is fabricated, manufactured or processed in some way. Normally, there are several steps to the process the item goes through, each with a set of data that will have to be captured. At each stage of the process the item will be scanned and whatever actions are done to it will be recorded. This chain of scans and data provide a very accurate trail of the items existence from assembly to a finished product. With this information you also have a line of accountability when there are defects or production issues.

##### Components of a Work In Process System

All work in process systems consist of these 5 components:

- WIP tracking software

- Barcode Scanner

- Mobile Computer

- Wireless infrastructure

- Barcode Printers
