Hand Held Terminals bring all the advantages of advanced, real-time and hands-free mobile computing to workers in the wholesale cash & carry and delivered business sectors. These rugged devices combine durability and speed with the very latest technology and extensive functionality.

Use handheld terminals to keep track of everything in your inventory. Improve efficiency with handheld terminals in the warehouse, so front-end sales and delivery processes go smoothly.

- Easy to Use – Handheld terminals are easy to use, and they coordinate seamlessly with your office computers, reducing the need for manual syncing. These mobile computers are compact enough to carry around in your hand, in a belt pouch, or in a holder in your vehicle, so you can take them with you across a large corporate campus or to a separate area of a large work yard. Miniature backlit keypads built into these devices and touch-sensitive screens let you alter data, scroll through menus, and enter commands without returning to a central computer first.

- Convenient Analysis – Powerful computing makes handheld terminals useful for more than simple recordings of bar code data. You can analyze inventory levels, check product specifications in an internal database, or surf the Internet to get manufacturer contact information with handheld computers that are equipped with wireless and Bluetooth capabilities. Send information directly from your handheld terminal to a central computer system or to your POS systems to enable real-time access to all relevant data from anywhere in your facility.

- Rugged Designs – Because they are designed to handle cold, wet, or windy weather, rugged handheld terminals can be used in your outdoor equipment yard or open-air storage facility. Durable units that can handle bumps, jostles, and drops onto concrete surfaces hold up well to everyday wear and tear and to occasional accidents. Water-resistant handheld computers withstand splashes and driving rain, enabling you to keep working outside in inclement weather.

##### Mobile Computers

Mobile Computers combines PC and scanning functions into a single device that can be outfitted with off-the-shelf or custom software applications that perform everyday tasks, such as monitoring deliveries, tracking assets, and managing inventory.

Like wireless scanners, Mobile Computers scan barcodes and capture data. They both support multiple interface options and come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and styles. But that’s where the similarities end.

And because mobile computers run on familiar operating systems such as Windows, Android, and Linux, they offer the same functionality as a desktop computer or laptop. This enables your mobile workforce to improve productivity from any location.

These powerful processors are equipped with a barcode scan engine and act as their own host, which means you can instantly update and edit information as you capture it. You can also:

- Securely access programs or databases stored in the cloud or your office using the latest Wi-Fi technologies such as 802.11 a/b/g/n

- Take advantage of high-speed WLAN or WWAN networks, such as the 4G HSPA+ worldwide network or the 3.5G EVDO/CDMA network

- Add additional memory using expandable card slots

- Accurately pinpoint the locations of employees, assets, and businesses with optional GPS capabilities

- Easily sync with modems, printers, and headsets using Bluetooth wireless connectivity

- Always stay connected via phone using integrated cellular service.

Whether yours is a small business or an enterprise, that combination makes our handheld computers easy to deploy, easy to use and easy to support.

We are an official Business Partner with Honeywell and thereby provide all of its devices embedded with our customized software as per customer requirements.
