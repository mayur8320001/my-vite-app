Proximity sensors detect the presence of objects that are nearly placed without any point of contact. Since there is no contact between the sensors and sensed object and lack of mechanical parts, these sensors have long functional life and high reliability.

##### Working

A proximity sensor emits an electromagnetic or electrostatic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (such as infrared), and waits for the return signal or changes in the field. The object which is being sensed is known as the proximity sensor’s target.

- **Inductive Proximity sensors** – They have an oscillator as input to change the loss resistance by the proximity of an electrically conductive medium. These sensors are preferred for metal targets.

- **Capacitive Proximity sensors** – They convert the electrostatic capacitance variation flanked by the detecting electrode and the ground electrode. This occurs by approaching the nearby object with a variation in an oscillation frequency. To detect the nearby object, the oscillation frequency is transformed into a direct current voltage which is compared with a predetermined threshold value. These sensors are preferred for plastic targets.
  Aarkay provides proximity sensors of highest quality, durability & repeatability to meet today’s tough industrial requirements. We provide a wide range of proximity sensors to meet all types of applications.

##### Applications

- Used in automation engineering to define operating states in process engineering plants, production systems and automating plants

- Used in windows, and the alarm is activated when the window opens

- Used in machine vibration monitoring to calculate the difference in distance between a shaft and its support bearing

- Typical applications include the detection, position, inspection and counting on automated machines and manufacturing systems. They are also used in the following machinery: packaging, production, printing, plastic molding, metal working, food processing, etc.

We are an official Business Partner with Pepperl+Fuch and provide all types of Proximity Sensors suitable for your needs and requirements.
