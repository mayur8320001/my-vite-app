Inclination sensors provide angle feedback for motion control or detect critical tilt position limits. Applications include real-time inclination monitoring in a dip-coating system for car bodies, or tilt-angle monitoring on mobile equipment.

Key features

Angle and rotation measurement, particularly where hardly accessible
Improved safety, for example at cranes
Robust, encapsulated housing with high IP rating
For durable use in harsh environment
Acceleration Sensors
Accurate and easily programmable acceleration sensors are used in wind power plants to monitor machine vibration. This feedback allows the system to predict possible machine component wear or unsafe structural load conditions.

Key Features

Acceleration sensors for detection of acceleration, vibration and shock levels at machines and facilities
Transmission of the measured acceleration values to master controller via CANopen or analog interface
Easy integration of redundant safety relay output into safety system
Redundant relay output will trip once the factory default limit has been exceeded
Whether you want to monitor the inclination angle of a machine component or the acceleration values of system structures or components, Aarkay offers the right solution for your needs from one of the leading top brand â€œPepperl+Fuchs.
