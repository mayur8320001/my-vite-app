title: "Ultrasonic Sensors"
excerpt: "The complex distribution networks of supply chain and logistics are prone to product counterfeiting. With the use of Tracking and Tracing Solutions, which applies a unique RFID or serialized barcode identifier on items, packages, cases or pallets, the industry-wide concerns can be effectively resolved by providing a reliable product pedigree as it contains the traceable history of each ownership change along the supply chain."

Ultrasonic Sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic waves. The sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the wave reflected back from the target. Ultrasonic Sensors measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception.

An optical sensor has a transmitter and receiver, whereas an ultrasonic sensor uses a single ultrasonic element for both emission and reception. In a reflective model ultrasonic sensor, a single oscillator emits and receives ultrasonic waves alternately. This enables miniaturization of the sensor head.

**Why use an Ultrasonic Sensor?**
Ultrasound is reliable in any lighting environment and can be used inside or outside. Ultrasonic sensors can handle collision avoidance for a robot, and being moved often, as long as it isn’t too fast.

Ultrasonics are so widely used, they can be reliably implemented in grain bin sensing applications, water level sensing, drone applications and sensing cars at your local drive-thru restaurant or bank.

Ultrasonic rangefinders are commonly used as devices to detect a collision.

##### Ultrasonic Sensors are best used in the non-contact detection of:

- Presence

- Level

- Position

- Distance

- Non-contact sensors are also referred to as proximity sensors.

##### Ultrasonics are Independent of:

- Light

- Smoke

- Dust

- Color

- Material (except for soft surfaces, i.e. wool, because the surface absorbs the ultrasonic sound wave and doesn’t reflect sound.)

Long range detection of targets with varied surface properties. Ultrasonic sensors are superior to infrared sensors because they aren’t affected by smoke or black materials, however, soft materials which don’t reflect the sonar (ultrasonic) waves very well may cause issues. It’s not a perfect system, but it’s good and reliable.

##### Applications Involving Ultrasonic Detection:

Ultrasonic Distance Measurement- Ex. Distance measurement would be applied in a garage parking application, sensing when a vehicle is pulled completely into a garage.
Ultrasonic Sensors for water level detection-Tank level measurement, Fuel gauging, irrigation control.
Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection-Our UAV Sensors for Drones as well as our proximity sensors that are used for robots are for obstacle detection.
Ultrasonic sensors are a reliable, cost-effective solution for distance sensing, level, and obstacle detection.
