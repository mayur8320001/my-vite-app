##### DISPATCH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Dispatch Management System directs incoming and outgoing traffic efficiently and follows the status of all your rolling stock and on-road personnel, providing for improved control and visibility of your trucking operations. Your Dispatcher will know the location of your assets (trucks and trailers) at all times, their load status, their availability and their usage, enabling tight control of your resources. With a few mouse clicks, a dispatcher creates trips (a route for pick-ups and/or deliveries) by combining resources (drivers, trucks and trailers) and then assigns orders to the trip by simply dragging and dropping orders from the pick-up board.

The user interface in the dispatch module is very flexible and highly customizable to meet the needs of any operation and the personal preferences of the dispatchers themselves. Dispatchers have visibility of all outstanding orders that require a pick-up or a delivery. Using powerful filtering capabilities of the Centerline software, dispatchers can limit views to only those orders that are of interest, reducing screen clutter, eliminating errors and allowing for efficient scheduling of freight orders.

Dispatch module contains tools to ensure assets are being used productively. Action Level indication, in conjunction with mobile computing technology automatically tells dispatchers which trips need their attention. It allows dispatcher to identify drivers who are idle as well as those who will soon be idle based on the work assigned to their itinerary. Action level indication helps improve dispatcher productivity which in turn improves driver productivity and asset utilization.
