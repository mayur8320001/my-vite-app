A Rotary Encoder is a type of position sensor which is used for determining the angular position of a rotating shaft. It generates an electrical signal, either analog or digital, according to the rotational movement.

Rotary encoders convert rotary position to an analog (e.g., analog quadrature) or digital (e.g., digital quadrature, 32-bit parallel, or USB) electronic signal. This rotary encoder is also known as quadrature encoder or relative rotary encoder and its output is a series of square wave pulses.

Rotary encoders with optical or magnetic scanning precisely acquire position in steel production, wind power plants, cranes and ships as well as in explosion-proof versions in painting lines. Miniature versions ensure the correct position in medical technology and SIL3 approved absolute rotary encoders ensure the necessary safety.

In addition to high-quality rotary encoders for almost every application, we also offer extensive accessories such as programming tools, displays and assembly components for quick and simple commissioning and seamless integration into your processes.

**Advantages of the Rotary encoder**

We know that the rotary encoder is a photoelectric rotary measuring device, the measured angular displacement will be directly converted into a digital signal to its advantage is reflected in the following four aspects:

- Output device coupled to the shaft through the joint, can directly detect the rotational displacement amount according to the rotational displacement amount of the shaft.

- Without home return start. (Only absolute) absolute type, the rotation angle as an absolute numerical value parallel output.

- Direction of rotation can be detected. The incremental output by the time A and B phases, the absolute direction of rotation can be mastered by increasing or decreasing the code.

- According to the resolution and rich output model, select the most appropriate sensor. According to the required accuracy and cost, circuit connection, select the appropriate sensor.

Aarkay offers a wide variety of rotary encoders for every feedback application including incremental, absolute, miniature and heavy duty rotary encoders from top renowned brand Pepperl+Fuchs.
