##### Flexible control technology for smart factories

Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, digitalization and smart factory – these are the keywords that are everywhere and are signaling a change in industrial machine and system manufacturing. Regardless of the exact definition of the term, all approaches have one goal: to produce a lot size of 1 in the same quality as larger quantities – this at a competitive price.

Modern control technology, connectivity and efficient big data handling are success factors on your way to machine and system concepts. Which data helps to optimize the production process, where the data is analyzed, which algorithms and rules apply to refine them. Smart factories offer numerous opportunities and new, digital business models – on the way, however, there are many challenges to meet.

The digital factory is calling: Flexibly implementable machines, big data handling and global connectivity is in demand.

As an automation partner, we support you in this challenge which extends far beyond the current understanding of machine control. In addition to sequence and process control, including motion control and Safety, a wide range of data must be collected for higher level systems and delivered promptly as well as safely. Of course, as a manufacturer of complete automation solutions ourselves, we cannot provide finished 4.0 systems. Our extremely compact, modular and scalable control architecture however, supports future-oriented machine and system concepts. This is where our extensive machine and application know-how comes in.

**Key Features**

- Flexibility through modularization

- High availability: predictive maintenance

- Connectivity from the sensor up to the cloud

- Data Security and Safety

- Simply implement the complex

Automation 4.0 goes beyond just gathering information about processes happening at the plant level. Rather than being reactive, Automation 4.0 focuses more on being proactive.

Think of it as intelligent equipment or leveraging the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Imagine every sensor and piece of equipment connected either wirelessly or hardwired through a gateway directly to your (secure and controlled) network accessible from your computer, tablet or smartphone. Industry 4.0 is designed around constant connection to information—sensors, drives, valves, all working together with a single common goal: minimizing downtime and increasing efficiency. Individual pieces of equipment can directly report their health or degradation, ensuring timely replacements. This philosophy goes far beyond tracking the hours meter on a machine with a regular preventive maintenance schedule.
