Vehicle mount mobile computers put robust computing power in a rugged form factor designed to handle the vibration of forklifts, fleet cars, delivery trucks and other vehicles. These devices provide increased productivity and reduced errors in picking, put-away, shipping, and receiving applications. From the warehouse floor to inside a freezer, these terminals provide real-time access to the data you need in any environment.

**We will advise you on the best vehicle mounted terminal to suit your needs. Some important considerations when selecting a terminal include:**

- Mounting brackets: The correct way of mounting the terminal is key

- Screens: Different applications may require different screen sizes, so size does matter

- Accessories: With hundreds of inputs a day, robust keyboards are a must

- Standard elements: Terminals that have a standard body yet flexible screens allow harmonization of the management of your terminal park

- Cabling: A DC-DC converter attached to the back of the terminal avoids complex montage and facilitates accessibility during maintenance
