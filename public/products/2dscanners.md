Two-dimensional (2D) scanners can read both 1D and 2D Barcodes. They can also read damaged or poorly printed barcodes, which makes them ideal for environments where reliability and flexibility are important.

Companies with field service personnel prefer 2 D Barcode Scanners because they can capture images of documents and signatures, which minimize their risk of fraud. They can also read barcodes from any angle for complete and accurate scans.

2D imagers capture an image field and then decode the result. Due to 2D imagers having a wider scope or area than other barcode scanners, a 2D imager can read virtually any 1D or 2D barcode including: QR codes, Data Matrix, and PDF417. 2D imagers are the most powerful of the 3 barcode scanners and are ideal for individuals needing rapid scanning action, such as those at an event or working in outdoor environments.

##### Advantages:

- Versatility: A 2D barcode scanner can scan virtually every barcode symbology.

- Powerful: 2D scanners, because of their image capture processing, can read barcodes from nearly every surface type including computer or mobile device screens, and even scan through glass surfaces. Their decoding ability also allows for the user to successfully read heavily damaged barcodes.

##### Disadvantages:

- Price: 2D barcode scanners are typically more expensive than linear imagers or laser barcode scanners.

**On Comparing**

Because of their versatility, 2D barcode scanners are quickly replacing 1Ds as the scanner of choice for most organizations. However, they aren’t always a perfect fit for everybody. To determine whether you need a barcode scanner with a 1D or a 2D scan engine, compare common features below. If you still need help, feel free to contact our Support Team.
