excerpt: "Two-dimensional (2D) scanners can read both 1D and 2D Barcodes. They can also read damaged or poorly printed barcodes, which makes them ideal for environments where reliability and flexibility are important."

A barcode printer is a printer designed to produce barcode labels which can be attached to other objects. Barcode printers use either direct thermal or thermal transfer techniques to apply ink to labels. Thermal transfer printers use ink ribbons to apply the barcode directly into the label, while thermal transfer printers use heat to blacken the barcode onto the label.

While both are effective, barcodes produced from direct thermal printers are more likely to become unreadable if exposed to elements such as heat, sunlight, and chemicals, and therefore don’t have the longevity of barcodes made with thermal transfer. Because of the longevity of the barcodes produced thermal transfer printers, as well as their overall printing quality and higher expense of production materials, they tend to be more costly than direct thermal printers. Barcode printers can be used for small business to industrial use, and are most commonly used for shipping products.

Direct Thermal Printers
Direct thermal printers use heat sensitive labels that blacken when they pass under the print head; no ribbon required. These printers are simple to operate and produce crisp barcode labels that scan easily. The barcode labels they produce are more appropriate for environments where they won’t be exposed to long-term sunlight, heat or abrasion. A direct thermal barcode label would be perfect for a short shelf life application, such as shipping. Direct thermal printers can also provide you with mobility. Some additional benefits include:

Maintenance costs on direct thermal printers are low because there are no ribbons to replace, all you need are the labels you’ll be printing on.
They provide durable and reliable use in office settings as well as industrial operations
Less waste because barcode labels can be printed in batches or one at a time.
But remember, direct thermal printing has its limitations as well, labels are sensitive to the environment there in and remain chemically active after printing. You need to be sure your application and environment is right for this type of printer.

Thermal Transfer Printers

Thermal transfer printers use a small ribbon roll that melts onto the label when heated by the printhead, and this creates the image. This method produces a crisp barcode with a glossy finish. Thermal transfer labels are the most durable barcode labels available, they can withstand heat and moisture, abrasion, and they are long lasting. Other benefits of thermal transfer printers include:

Even with a small ribbon roll, maintenance costs are far less than an ink jet, laser, or dot matrix printer
They enable batch or single label printing, reducing waste and saving money
Thermal transfer printers can print on numerous kinds of stock
In addition to durable and reliable labels, the printer itself can be used in office settings or industrial operations
As you can see, thermal transfer printers are much more suitable for applications that require a long-lasting label, or may be in a harsh environment. Thermal transfer printers provide the best quality barcode labels of any other type of printer, but to ensure this kind of quality you must be positive that the ribbon and labels you decide to use are compatible. If not, this can cause internal printer problems.

Here is a table that compares the advantages and disadvantages of several types of printers.
