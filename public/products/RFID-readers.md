Radio Frequency Identification Readers or RFID readers are used to gather information from an RFID tag, which is used to track individual objects. Radio waves are used to transfer data from the tag to a reader.

RFID is a technology similar in theory to bar codes. However, the RFID tag does not have to be scanned directly, nor does it require line-of-sight to a reader. The RFID tag it must be within the range of an RFID reader, which ranges from 3 to 300 feet, in order to be read. RFID technology allows several items to be quickly scanned and enables fast identification of a particular product, even when it is surrounded by several other items.

RFID tags have not replaced bar codes because of their cost and the need to individually identify every item.

RFID technology may be used in a variety of applications including:

- Passports

- Smart cards

- Airplane luggage

- Toll booth passes

- Home appliances

- Merchandise tags

- Animal and pet tags

- Automobile key-and-lock

- Monitoring heart patients

- Pallet tracking for inventory

- Telephone and computer networks

- Operation of spacecraft and satellites
