Laser Scanners are the most popular type of barcode scan engine because they can scan barcodes at distances greater than two feet. However, they only read linear, or one-dimensional (1D), barcodes such as UPC-A, which is widely used by retailers and grocers.

Another example of a 1D scanner is a linear imager. Unlike a laser scanner—which uses a beam and mirrors to read barcodes—a linear imager captures an image of a 1D barcode to read it. Linear imagers are a great option when scanning barcodes that are less than two feet away.

CCD (Charged Coupling Device) barcode scanners use an imaging engine to take a picture of the barcode and then decode the characters. CCD barcode scanners are “linear imagers” meaning that you will still see a red focus line when triggering the scan.

1D Scanners are the most common and the most popular. The laser scanner operates by emitting a red diode laser that reflects back the barcode for processing. Bluetooth laser barcode scanners are small and easy to use. Due to their portability, they are the perfect solution for inventory, attendance, or retail arbitrage.

##### Advantages:

- Fast: Laser scanners can decode extremely fast.

- Accurate: Laser scanners scan most 1D barcodes with ease. Just point and scan for quick results.

- Powerful: Unlike a CCD scanner, laser scanners can read large barcodes and from longer distances. Some laser scanners can read barcodes from over 50 feet away.

- Durable: CCD scanners have no internal moving parts so they are typically a bit more durable than a laser scanner.

- More economical: CCD scanners, on average, are usually less costly than other barcode scanners.

- Scan In Direct Sunlight & On Device Screens: Essentially, a CCD scanner is “taking a picture” of the barcode. Due to this scanning process, CCD scanners are able to operate in bright sunlight. Most CCD scanners are also able to read scans off a computer or other devices screens.

##### Disadvantages:

- Ambient Light: Because a laser scanner functions by reflecting light back, high ambient light (such as direct sunlight) may cause difficulties when trying to scan.

- Laser Limitations: Most laser barcode scanners cannot read barcodes from a computer or mobile device display. Furthermore, if the barcode is damaged, faded or too small in scale, the laser barcode scanner may not be able to capture the scan.

- Barcode Size Limitations: CCD scanners are unable to read barcodes that are wider than the imager line.

- Scan Distance Limitations: Most CCD scanners are only able to read barcodes from a few inches away.
