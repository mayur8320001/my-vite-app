## Barcode based Production & Packaging

- Here we provide complete & long run solution as per your requirements including designing of unique barcode for each and every primary/secondary product/material (carton/packets etc.)

- We give you this solution in two ways-Manual and Auto. In manual mode, an operator will operate software include data insertion/selection/capturing and printing actions.

- In Auto mode, the software itself operate the overall system.

- In both ways firstly the product identification/validation will be done based on Barcode technology(1D/2D barcode/data matrix/EANcode/Pharmacode etc.), next the data will be fetched live on screen.

- Next, the weight validation based on integrated weighing machine/conveyer or vision based inspection/validation/verification will be done(if required), next based on parameters validation, product rejection will be done then finally barcode sticker/direct part marking/ direct product printing mechanism will be operate only for valid FG product/material.
