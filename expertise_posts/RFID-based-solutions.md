## RFID Technology based Solutions

- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology allows you to use electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically-stored information.

- Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture(AIDC)

- We already have demo RFID based softwareâ€™s for the following solutions:-
  - Library management and books detection system.
  - Truck tracking system.
  - Unmanned weighing bridge system.
  - Attendance log with Snap verification system.
  - Marathon Race Runner tracking system.
  - Parking Management System using RFID with automatic boom barrier.
