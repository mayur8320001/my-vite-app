## Dispatch Management System

- DMS ensures you that only valid FG cartons/bales/rolls/palettes/crates etc. to be dispatched from valid transport truck/vehicle against the delivery order (DO).

- Single System can handle multiple dispatch points without any human mistakes while loading material to truck/vehicle.
  System operated on the basis of barcode technology. Each and every FG cartons/bales/rolls/palettes/crates etc. has been barcodized with unique barcode.

- System allows user to load complete DO into HHT (hand held terminal or mobile computer) device then only scan FG cartons/bales/rolls/palettes/crates etc. & load into truck one by one. Single HHT device per dispatch loading points.

- DMS is majorly advantageous when you have more than one dispatch loading points inline then there can be chances of loading wrong material to wrong transport truck/vehicle while doing manually which hampers your feedback from clients when they get invalid material.

- Even DMS will generate customized DO as per Customer with respect to valid scanned loaded material and can update data to existing ERP real time. (if required)

- Finally customized reports which give you complete MIS regarding dispatch of material.
